/**
 * 
 * This class does much of the heavy lifting for pattern matching.  It has to decide
 * what to do with hygeinic macro expanses to avoid accidental scope capture.
 * 
 * Now understand almost enough to implement the lazy expansion system described in the
 * paper.  Only thing is, we have 2 transformations: 1 for the user, 1 for the compiler.
 * Then again, might be best to use same algorithm for both, since the user should be
 * able to see that scopes don't overlap.
 * 
 * Second problem is scope propogation from template to pattern.  This is also rather
 * intense, but we just have to analyze the template in the macro's current environment
 * and ensure that it doesn't spit out any macros we haven't seen yet (or make a 2-pass parse).
 * Note that with structure, things may uppropogate in extremely complex and interesting ways.
 * 
 * What if we define new notation to refer to different versions of symbols?  For example, a macro
 * expansion could produce macroname' and macroname$?  Maybe we could alter the lexical structure of
 * the language to create certain macro-legal syntax with which the user cannot interfere.  This could
 * mirror syntax highlighting in some sense.
 * 
 * The automatic legality checks should prevent use of macros that use symbols defined outside of
 * their enclosing environment.
 * (let-syntax ((divide (lambda (x )
 * (let ((/ +))
 * (syntax-case x ()
 * (( e 1 e 2 ) (syntax (/ e 1 e 2 ))))))))
 * (let ((/ âˆ—)) (divide 2 1)))
 * The above code returns a syntax-case that always has a variable that has gone out of scope.  In
 * reality, it should just break.  How do we break this reliably?  Maybe we can put additional
 * restrictions on the kind of functions that can appear within a transformer (stipulate that any
 * generated macros must be usable outside of the function if the function appears inside of
 * any sort of syntax definition).  This seems sketchy, but it may work if we have a good function
 * tracking system.  The question is: can we definitely track all user-generated functions in this
 * way?  Alternatively we could, upon finding that a syntax-case is in use, prevent returning it
 * outside of any scope that it relies upon.  This means that we can't set! something to a syntax-case
 * inside of certain let statements, can't return one out of a lambda in some cases, etc.
 *
 * 
 * What to display to the user?
 * 1) Must be readable (no "G1" identifier).
 * 2) Must be capable of showing non-capture.
 * 3) Should not rely on color or other design anomolies. 
 * 
 * What to pass into the interpreter?
 * 1) Must not use non-standard language features.
 * 2) Must expand performantly.
 * 
 * Can we merge these?
 * The only major problem seems to be the use of things in
 * the macro which may have been shadowed in the expansion environment.
 * (let (if #f) (or2 #t #t))
 * Use the fact that we know where all the enviroments are.  We can find that
 * "if" and at compile time, figure out what happens to it.  Can probably
 * do this in the reverse parse phase, and keep some of that info around.
 * 
 * Rules:
 * 1) Any variable that exists in the pattern, we do not bother with.  It's named
 * by the expand-time environment and should therefore become that symbol (without renaming?).
 * 2) Any variable that comes purely from the template, we 
 * check against the expansion-time environment to see if it's been remapped,
 * and if it has, rename it in all occurrences.
 * 3) Any pattern literals should fail to match if defined in the expand-time environment,
 * since they have stopped being literals.  It should probably be illegal to define
 * a literal that exists in the macro definition's environment.
 * 4) Any literals or quoted expressions in the template do absolutely nothing.  We don't
 * remap them or try to change the display.
 * 
 * Problem: if this matches a list, then what happens when the list casts it to a ChildedSyntax?
 * 
 * Should it really be a possibleSyntax?
